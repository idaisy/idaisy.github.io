# A lawsuit between Facebook, Inc. & Power Ventures, Inc
 Steve Vachani(穷困潦倒的Power Ventures CEO)在2006年想出一个将所有的社交网络集合成超级社交网络的主意，他建立了Power Ventures网站可以帮助用户管理汇总各种社交网络内容(通过用户提供相应帐号密码)，并提供信息传送服务。Facebook为了维护自身网站利益，以系统入侵及散布垃圾邮件的罪名起诉Steve。第一轮官司Facebook获得胜利，Steve需支付1800W美元的罚金，面临公司倒闭，个人破产负债累累的局面。Steve坚持抗争，最终找到了Amy Sommer Anderson（律所实习生一枚，时薪55美元）帮忙上诉。Amy机智的发现了机会，推翻了散布垃圾邮件的罪名，Steve不需要支付高额罚金了。但是他另一个系统入侵罪名仍未撤销，下一步Amy和Steve将会向Supreme Court继续上诉。所以在此之前，当你向同伴分享用户名和密码，且同伴登录了你的帐号，就可能属于违反计算机欺诈和滥用法案，会被检举逮捕的哦，Laf...

- It's high [stakes]{风险} and [aggressive]{侵略性的}.

- And I can screw them up and see your fierce [commentary]{评论}.

- It's exciting, [thrilling]{毛骨悚然的}, you are seeing the world through my digital eyes.

- And they say what we just did is something like digital [trespassing]{侵入}, climbing onto their servers without permission, which could land someone in jail.

- how Facebook protects its [turf]{势力范围} and what it means for the future of the internet. 

- It organizes the [chaotic]{混乱的} early social networking web into one place, and a lot of people liked it.

- It's [euphoric]{欣快的}. 

- It's kind of like [pinching]{捏} yourself to see it's real.

- It's kind of like an [existential]{存在主义的} crisis for a site like Facebook 

- Facebook essentially said that you're [violating]{违反} Facebook's terms and conditions.

- And so this fight sets the [groundwork]{基础}. 

- Charge two - for good measure - [spamming]{垃圾邮件}.

- hey, come use Power Ventures, that was [deceptive]{欺诈的}, unwanted [solicitation]{恳求；诱惑} - spam.

- If someone calls you a spammer, there's a [connotation]{暗示} that you're from the [underworld]{黑社会}.

- It's like being an [adulterer]{奸夫} in [Puritan]{清教徒} America. It's your [scarlet]{罪孽深重的} letter.

- No, Steve is [dogged]{顽强的}. 

- The only case she had ever tried was [mock]{模拟的} trial in law school.

- Did he [reimburse]{偿还} you for that?

- He felt [condescending]{谦逊的} (laughter).

- all I have to go off at that point is [intuition]{直觉} 

- But actually she's [lowballing]{向顾客虚报低价} herself. 

- You can be professional and you can be [courteous]{有礼貌的}.

- A decision here would set [precedent]{先例} for a big chunk of the country. It's just one step below the [Supreme]{至高} Court.

- One of the judges liked the idea of Steve's website and even tried to give him a [compliment]{恭维}, but he's too nervous to hear the praise.

- Steve is [fumbling]{笨拙的} for the right words.

- And I just, like, [leapt]{跳跃} out of, you know, the covers and probably 

- Steve and Amy, the down-and-out CEO and the [newbie]{菜鸟} lawyer, they had killed it. 

- this is the [messy]{凌乱的} [outcome]{结局}.

- it will not [rehear]{再审} their case.
