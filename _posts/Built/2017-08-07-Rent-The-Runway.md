Jennifer Hyman和Jennifer Fleiss，两位女士想要拥有最新款式的时装却支付不起高昂的价格，决定通过Rent The Runway的方式将其实现。

Rent The Runway，美国如今最受欢迎的时尚公司之一，成长速度令人惊叹，年收入上亿，有着1200多名员工。虽然它的核心产品是名牌服装，你会惊奇地发现仅有10名员工在其时尚部门工作，其他大部分员工都在技术部门工作，它本质上是一家科技公司。
顾客可以在网上或者APP租用时装。相较时装昂贵的价格，顾客只需要支付一小部分金额，然后就可以穿的美美的渡过一个愉快的夜晚，第二天整休后再将衣服邮寄回。

the famous fashion designer
how two women wanted high-fashion couldn't afford the price tag, decided to make it possible to rent the runway

one of hottest fashion companies in the US, growing like crazy  it's doing more than 100 million dollars a year  Revenue  it hires 1200 employees  given that it's core product is designer dresses   you might be surprised to discover as i was, there just ten of it's employees work in the fashion department  most of the rest they work for technology company   because that's actually what rent the runway is.   the way works is  you go online  go to the app and you rent the dress (might caused thousands of dollars to buy) you only pay a small fraction of that and you look fabulous for one night  mail it back

The access economy is a business model where goods and services are traded on the basis of access rather than ownership: it refers to renting things temporarily rather than selling them permanently. 

core founder Jennifer Hyman and Jennifer Fleiss came up this idea when they were met at Harvard Business School in 2008 [ after she watched her sister overspend on a new dress rather than wear an old one to a party.]

2008年Jennifer Hyman和Jennifer Fleiss在哈佛商学院构想出这个创业项目。

graduates college  Jenn Hyman  job Junior analyst for the hotel company Starwood    about a year 22  [specious  we had enter the experience economy--Pine and Gilmore argue that businesses must orchestrate memorable events for their customers, and that memory itself becomes the product — the "experience".] People were getting married later and starting to value experience like travel  over owning things
I had an idea   to launch the first honeymoon registry in the world   22 years old passion about this idea   I emailed the president of the Starwood  I paged him on this idea to start a wedding business   at Starwood where the corner will be the first honeymoon registry

keep quiet?   one of the experiences that really impacted me was   I had a female boss  35/36 I would often raise my hands in the meeting, speaking, make a point.  grab me after meeting one day  feedback   important for your career  you really need to shut up 
girl   it would be much more becoming if you act sweet in conversations   too confident, too bold, and it's coming across the wrong way  crying  overflow   a more senior man saw me  credit this guy for my entire career   he took me aside (I didn't know office politics at that time) Jenn, you keep doing what you're doing, because that women's gonna be working for you one day   
map out how this would happen? I start to work on it  spent next 3 years working on it  fun experience a) work on something that I loved and passionate about b)be part of the process of creation 

why leave? I always thought that I would go to business school 
I thought the track was you work for 4 years(in college) go to business school   I was at Starwood for 3+ years, I applied to business school  
 
why business school?  I have always had big dreams for my career 
Sara Blakely appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2006
amazing business/ also like a real person 
You had to make a choice between having an incredible career as women or having a family. I always wanted them both.
a chance to think those things through 
think  where do I want to spend my time? What am I most passionate about?

Jennifer Fleiss How did you guys meet?
really funny story   my sister Becky prior to me going to business school  put a post note on my pillow one night with Jennifer Fleiss made a name on it  which is Jenny "card"  and she said that you had to meet this girl when you go to business school because a friend of hers knew  Jenny "card"
and my response to Becky at the time was you know I'll meet her if I meet her. needless to say, Jenny was one of the first people I've met at business school because we were placed in the same section  because her name had been on a post note for me  I was like "Oh my god, you'll never believe this, my sister told me we need to be friends"   really fast friend  the rest is history

at what point did you say let's do business when we leave this place? 我们在大学第二年的九月一起过生日。十一月我回家过感恩节，在Becky的公寓里看到Becky刚去商店买的一件衣服 
higher cost her rent， as her responsible elder sister, I was remarking how she should probably wear one of the dresses in her closet again as suppose to be in credit card debt. Her response to me was you know everything in my closet is dead to me, I've been photograph it   the photographs are on Facebook and I need something new. 
Becky仅仅只是一个住在纽约的普通女孩，并不是名人。而她正在谈论不能穿着同一件衣服照相。
It was a light table moment for me, cause I realized I was having a conversation with my sister about the experience of wearing an amazing dress   of walking into a party feeling self-confidence  feeling beautiful   that's what's she cared about  
she didn't care about the actual ownership of the items in her closet    the other things she care about was the photograph would exist after party that she could post on Facebook and kind of share with everyone she knew how awesome she felt/ how confidence she felt in that way.  This idea happened on Saturday night, I go back to school on Monday  have launch with Jenny  we were talking about our weekend   Oh, I had this idea like what if we rent dresses?  She responded it, Oh, it sounds fun  let's work on this idea together  who do you think we should call to figure out if it's a good idea? 
I said we should call Diane Von Furstenberg  the famous fashion designer  
Jenny: Do you know Diane Von Furstenberg? 
I: Obviously I don't know Diane Von Furstenberg, but we could probably figure out her email address.
Jenny and I wrote an email that afternoon to many different versions of Diane Von Furstenberg's email address and we basically said Hey we are two women at Harvard Business School. we have an idea. We'd love to come and talk to you about it. And this is where we are luck, place to the situation. Because she or someone from her office open that email. She respond it I'll see you tomorrow at 5pm. We drove down to New York that next day Put down DVF dresses, and walked into her office and introduced ourselves cofounders rent the runway.  
You had the name at that point?  Yeah, we did everything very quickly.
didn't really have a structural idea 
iterating the idea by picturing it
initial idea what if we could rent the dresses that she is selling on her website 
what if we powered the rental for her on DVF.com
And when we chat with her, she was not "" the idea of renting cloth general, and thought that it would canibalize her retail sells, delute her brand  she was ready to end the meeting with us after a few minutes 
I started asking her questions what she dislike about this idea?
She scared about and by the end of what was almost an hour and half conversation  we learned that a lot of her customers were in 50s/60s and that  if we were to build business that could make her relevant to put her products into the hands of women in their 20s/30s/40s  that might be interesting to her and she might want to work with us. 
was she warm? nervous?
funny story   at that first meeting  I always learned when you in the first meeting scheduled the second meeting  
when we in the first meeting  we scheduled a conversation for a few weeks later with her 
fast forward few weeks  We driving to the meeting and we get a call while we were in the car from her assistant.
we are at Westside highway  we are about forty blocks from her office. and her assistant called and says Diane no longer wants to see you    and  I said  you know well we were on our way  we were just coming to say hi. And her assistant like No She really doesn't want to see you. She's not interested in this idea 
I said OH Yeah We are just around the corner  we are just drop by for a second.  and again her assistant very firmly said She doesn't want to you   what do you not understand?  I said OH...we are cutting off, we are cutting off. I hang up then I speed down the WestSide Highway and we were at her office  we just showed up 
crash? cry  a little bit upset about the situation  much more natural reaction   I was like, we were just gonna do this, what we have to lose   what's worst thing in the world we show up she doesn't meet us?   great  then we have a story we can tell all of our friends
Second meeting Diane agree to meet with them and giving them pretty good advice
I don't want you do this on my website  you're gonna have to sell this idea to other designers and get lots of people on board if I've gonna do this too.
she give us permission to make it consumer facing business to approach the rest of the industry 
It sounds like she rewrote her business plan right there
introduced us to one or two people in the industry   we then would meet with those people     so on and so forth
but we continue to just called call people, so one of the next people we called call was the President of Neiman Marcus.
HBS alumnus   access his email address 
"Yeah, this is a really good idea, women had been renting the runway for my stores for decades. It's called buying something, keeping tags on it and return it to the store." Which probably cost them millions of dollars.   dirty secret of retail


Jenn and her business partner built a web site where women could rent designer dresses for a fraction of the retail price. As the company grew, they dealt with problems that many female entrepreneurs face, including patronizing investors and sexual harassment. Despite these challenges, Rent The Runway now rents dresses to nearly six million women and has an annual revenue of $100 million. PLUS in our postscript "How You Built That," how Dustin Hogard and his business partner designed a survival belt that's full of tiny gadgets and thin enough to wear every day.
