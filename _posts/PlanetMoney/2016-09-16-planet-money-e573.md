1. So I was actually kind of [irritated]{使恼怒}, you know? 

2. There's this chart that gets [cited]{引用，援引}  a lot, maybe you've even seen it. 

3. It's from a government report on textbook prices and shows the price of new textbooks over the past decade, and it is a very [steep]{陡峭的} line. 

4. In this case, that relationship was [severed]{被割断，中断}. 

5. Economists call this the [principal]{委托人} agent problem. 

6. They're always talking about, gee, we have this new [coverage]{覆盖} of these new topics. 

7. Koch did not want to [weigh in]{发表有分量的意见}, so we did something more awkward. 

8. Let me just start by saying thank you for agreeing to come in and be [grilled]{盘问，使受高温烤炙} about the price of your textbook.

9. I mean, people who get their homes [renovated]{翻新，修补} talk about what a nightmare it is, and health care is this famously broken market.


10. Well, I think it's - whenever you have a principal agent problem, there's a risk that the agent, which in this case is the professor, doesn't do due [diligence]{勤奋} and doesn't do their job correctly and look for the best interests of the principal, which in this case is the student.

13. Jonathan Helliwell is a financial analyst at Panmure Gordon, one of the oldest [brokerages]{经纪行} in England. 

14. People came up with new ways to avoid those higher prices - textbook [rentals]{租金}, illegal downloads. 

15. One textbook salesman I talked to called it a [spiral]{螺旋形的，不断上升} of [destruction]{破坏，摧毁}.

16. It sat [astride]{跨在...上} a business which was simple - produce books, and that's what it did. 

17. We are [ploughing]{投资，耕作} huge resources into creating a new set of instructional materials which help students and help instructors and do so at a much lower price than it's ever been seen before.

18. But for students, there is this one big [drawback]{缺点}.
