## 经济相关的QUIZ

Q：金钱是否可以买来幸福？ 

A：幸福感不仅取决于自己有多少钱，同时与别人有多少钱相关。（相互攀比）

Q：赚钱获取幸福感是有极限的？

A：没有答案，缺乏数据。但是可以引用一句施瓦辛格名言：my 30th million didn't make me as happy as my first million.

Q：美联储从何处设定2%的通胀率而不是3%或1%？有实际的学术研究支持么？

A：没有明确数据表明其他的两个是正确的数字。而作为缓冲，2是一个合适的约整数。

Q：有哪些关于战争的起源（盐/原油）小故事？

A：肉桂卷。蔗糖，加勒比地区古巴16世纪西班牙殖民史、19世纪独立战争、20世纪"大跃进"；肉桂，荷兰对产肉桂岛屿的血腥统治；肉豆蔻，[印度尼西亚的香料战争](http://www.360doc.com/content/16/0527/05/19663861_562625839.shtml)；小麦，罗马和埃及的战争，法国大革命；油也与战争相关。

Q：为何寄信件从西雅图寄往斯里兰卡或者加拿大，国际邮资都是相同的？

A：为了方便客户寄信，而不用太多考虑价格。(并不希望客户站在邮局排队选择路线浪费时间)寄件成本主要取决于人工工资。

Q：信件寄送的整个过程中成本和利润如何分配？

A：万国邮政联盟通过会议洽谈决定。

Q：Dave Outen的车辆保险从俄亥俄州转入加利福尼亚，费用翻了个倍，原因是？

A：人工费增加？不是。豪车增加？顶多产生5%的附加费。交通密度大容易造成车祸？有可能，但是对于翻倍的保险费而言依旧很多。还有一个观点是，在加利福尼亚，应该对富人收费更多。
