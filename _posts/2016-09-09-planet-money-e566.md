- [Calgary, Alberta]{卡尔加里，加拿大西部之一省}

- Calgary's up in Alberta, so it is [chilly]{冷飕飕的} most of the year.
- It's [slushy]{雪泥覆盖的}

- Colleen Baird is the elephant [curator]{馆长}

- have a whole [herd]{兽群} of elephants around them. 

- why did zoos and [aquariums]{水族池} give up one of the most useful tools a business has, the ability to buy and sell their assets? 

- Zoos bring sort of competition to have [prestige]{有声望的} animals. 

- We want one of those [gorillas]{大猩猩}, maybe a pair of those [giraffes]{长颈鹿}, and we are willing to pay.

- This is all [epitomized]{成为…的典范} by a German man named Carl Hagenbeck. 

- Hagenbeck could get you anything you wanted - polar bears, [hippopotamus]{河马}, wild Mongolian horses. 

- He'd get a request in from a zoo in Europe or America and then go out on the [expedition]{远征}. 

- He [recounts]{详细叙述} bloody scenes in the jungles, and the story gets worse.

- He put whole families on display with a little [domestic]{家庭的} scene, and he'd call it [anthropology]{人类学}.

- They slowly tried to distance themselves from [poachers]{偷猎者} and their pretty horrible techniques. 

- It's the 1960s, 1970s, countries in Asia and Africa have been pushing back on this idea that guys in [pith helmets]{遮阳帽} could just [waltz in]{大摇大摆地走进} and drag away animals for some city zoo.

- Think Rachel Carson's the "Silent Spring" where everyone's beginning to [reassess]{重新考虑} how humans and nature and wild animals all interact.

- [implement]{实施} new [conservation]{保护} rules

- in [session]{会议}

- One of the assistant [secretaries]{秘书} of the [Interior]{内部}

- huge [smuggling]{走私} ring.

- a damaged [crate]{木箱} 

- 100,000 illegal [pelts]{剥去…的皮} 

- it's [leopard]{豹} skins, [jaguars]{美洲豹}, [pumas]{美洲狮}, [cheetahs]{猎豹}. T

- Now, even though this was [prompted]{导致} by trade in pelts and skins and [ivory]{象牙}, for the zoo community, this meant they had to change the way they did business.

- little [loophole]{漏洞}

- The rule became that animals should not be [commodities]{商品}, 

- the oldest trick in the book - [bartering]{以物易物}. 

- It's a [Caribbean]{加勒比地区的} [coral reef]{珊瑚礁}. And my favorite part was there's this giant [turtle]{海龟}.

- The New England Aquarium [breeds]{培育} and barters hundreds of the little guys. 

-  [translucent]{半透明的} jellyfish

- Your classic jelly design's a [pulsating]{搏动} Medusa with extremely long, very [diaphanous]{轻薄透明的} [tentacles]{触须}, mouth parts that look like [frilly]{饰有褶边的} [petticoats]{衬裙} or [unmentionables]{不可提及的}.

- a very unusual [physiognomy]{容貌}. 

- They kind of look like a [grumpy]{脾气坏的} dinner plate, if you can picture that.

- [snipefish]{鹭管鱼}, [lumpfish]{圆鳍鱼料}，[lookdown]{月鲹}, [burrfish]{刺鲀}

- Boston threw in some [grunts]{咕哝}, and in the end...

- I would say that trading a school of [mackerel]{鲭鱼} for a [flock]{群} of [puffins]{角嘴海雀} was one of the best trades that we New England aquariumites (ph) had managed to do.

- They don't want to set this [precedent]{先例} that a panda is worth a thousand turtles or whatever. 

- You don't get money or even some sort of [abstract]{抽象的} credit when you give up an animal. 

- a [wading]{趟水} pool

- a whole [convoy]{车队}, [veterinarians]{兽医}, the works. 

- Calgary got a new Indian [rhino]{犀牛} and [Komodo dragons]{科摩多龙} - for free of course. Still on the list - [lemurs]{狐猴}. 

- Ask Me Another is like [trivia]{琐事} night but funnier. 

- It is a [hilarious]{极其滑稽的} show.
