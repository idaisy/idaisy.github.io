- His [orchard]{果园} was high up on a mountain ridge in Lesotho. 

- We are able to tap into the market two to three weeks earlier than the South African [counterparts]{同行}.

- And you have to run [irrigation]{灌溉} over from the well to the orchards.

- He was posted [randomly]{随机的}, back when he was young, to Ghana in the [Peace Corps]{和平工作队}. 

- He's [bald]{秃头的}.

- This was an [intellectual]{智力的} question to be solved in an intellectual way, which is a [randomized]{使…随机化} controlled experiment.

- We sent them 200 and - the [equivalent]{相等物} of $250.

- But there is a [time-honored]{确立已久的} way to make something less risky.

- There are [statistics]{统计数字}. 

- a new insurance policy to protect our crops, animals and [poultry]{家禽}
 
- I think he sounds so [legit]{合法的} happy 

- would smile and would read you a [script]{剧本}.

- We recognize that you need help dealing with the [unpredictability]{不可预测} of [rainfall]{降雨量}.

- risk their [livelihoods]{生计}

- When you say you give me a little money and you might get a lot of money, that seems like a [lottery]{抽彩}. 

- I know this seems [over-the-top]{过多的}. 

- My first reaction was [delight]{愉快}. 

- If it did not rain in northern Ghana that year, they would have been on the [hook]{勾} for more money than they'd calculated in their [grant]{补助金}. 

- OK - no rain, no rain, [sprinkle]{少量}, then no rain, then, finally, the clouds opened up - not a lot - but enough to hit the [rainfall]{降雨量} target.

- And now I'm kind of in the [lurch]{挫折}. 
  
- They [cultivated]{种植} more corn. 
  
- [Amongst]{在…中} the people who we had given nothing other than a promise...

- So they got [literally]{确实地} nothing other than a piece of paper that said that under certain [circumstances]{状况}, they'll get money to make them whole. 

- So it was [remarkable]{出色的}. 

- So to [recap]{总结}, giving farmers money works. 

- [handing out]{分发} cash

- And as much as I begged Chris to [lord]{逞威风} this result over Dean - to say, in your face, man - they would not [comply]{服从}.

- [motivate]{促动} behavior

- out of the [sheer]{完全的} promise of having the risk lifted off their shoulders.

- make some [boreholes]{钻孔} for irrigation.

- the animal [husbandry]{农牧业}
