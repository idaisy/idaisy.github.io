1. So I was actually kind of <ruby>irritated<rt>使恼怒    </rt></ruby>, you know? 

2. There's this chart that gets <ruby>cited<rt>引用，援引</rt></ruby>  a lot, maybe you've even seen it. 

3. It's from a government report on textbook prices and shows the price of new textbooks over the past decade, and it is a very <ruby>steep<rt>陡峭的</rt></ruby> line. 

4. In this case, that relationship was <ruby>severed<rt>被割断，中断</rt></ruby>. 

5.  Economists call this the <ruby>principal<rt>委托人</rt></ruby> agent problem. 

6. They're always talking about, gee, we have this new <ruby>coverage<rt>覆盖</rt></ruby> of these new topics. 

7. Koch did not want to <ruby>weigh in<rt>发表有分量的意见 </rt></ruby>, so we did something more awkward. 

8. Let me just start by saying thank you for agreeing to come in and be <ruby>grilled<rt>盘问，使受高温烤炙</rt></ruby> about the price of your textbook.

9. I mean, people who get their homes <ruby>renovated<rt>翻新，修补</rt></ruby> talk about what a nightmare it is, and health care is this famously broken market.


9. Well, I think it's - whenever you have a principal agent problem, there's a risk that the agent, which in this case is the professor, doesn't do due <ruby>diligence<rt>勤奋</rt></ruby> and doesn't do their job correctly and look for the best interests of the principal, which in this case is the student. 

10. The biggest <ruby>expenditure<rt>开支</rt></ruby> for students is not the expenditure of money, but it's the expenditure of their time. 

11. So if somebody comes in and says I have a book that's - it's not as good, but it's going to save your students $30, I'm going to say given that they're going to spend 40, 50, 60, 70 hours reading this book over the course of a semester, am I really going to <ruby>skimp<rt>节省</rt></ruby> on a textbook to get something that's <ruby>inferior<rt>较差的，级别较低的</rt></ruby>? 

12. Jonathan Helliwell is a financial analyst at Panmure Gordon, one of the oldest <ruby>brokerages<rt>经纪行</rt></ruby> in England. 

13. People came up with new ways to avoid those higher prices - textbook <ruby>rentals<rt>租金</rt></ruby>, illegal downloads. 

14. One textbook salesman I talked to called it a <ruby>spiral<rt>螺旋形的，不断上升</rt></ruby> of <ruby>destruction<rt>破坏，摧毁</rt></ruby>.

15. It sat <ruby>astride<rt>跨在...上</rt></ruby> a business which was simple - produce books, and that's what it did. 

16. We are <ruby>ploughing<rt>投资，耕作</rt></ruby> huge resources into creating a new set of instructional materials which help students and help instructors and do so at a much lower price than it's ever been seen before.

17. But for students, there is this one big <ruby>drawback<rt>缺点</rt></ruby>.
