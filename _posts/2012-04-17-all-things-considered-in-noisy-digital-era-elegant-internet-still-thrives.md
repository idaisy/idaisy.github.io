本集讲了从1987年到现在一直在对公众提供服务的UNIX服务器 [SDF.org](http://sdf.org)。scateu有[一篇博客](http://scateu.me/2016/09/25/sdf-dot-org.html)来详细讲这件事。和水木清华、北大未名等BBS很相似。

 - [Audie Cornish]{主持人名字}. [Melissa Block]{主持人名字}. 
 - ... but using computers to share information and meet friends [predates]{日期上早于} the 21st century.
 - From New Hampshire Public Radio, [Todd Bookman]{人名} ...
 - Before Facebook, before MySpace, even before [Al Gore]{美国副总统, 1993-2001} ...
 - ... I guess, [Bullywith(ph)]{人名} is how you might say it.
 - Bullywith is this guy's [handle]{把手}, his screen name. Offline, he's Pat McNameeking, a 23-year-old college student in Concord, New Hampshire.
 - I'm connected to the Internet through an [ethernet]{以太网} cable I pulled down through the [ceiling]{天花板}. There's a big piece of [exposed]{裸露的} communication stuff, a bunch of telephone cable wires. 
 - [Perched]{栖息} over a small laptop, [Pat/Bullywith]{人名} logs into an online community called SDF. It's sort of like Facebook, Gmail and a gaming site all [rolled into one]{所有好品质集于一身}, but there aren't videos or pictures or even ads on the screen.
 - This is a lot more [elegant]{高雅}, I think. 
 - They were like the alternative to AOL and CompuServe back in the early days. But, nowadays, they're, you know, very, very [obscure]{不著名的}.
 - Rob Fleischman is a computer scientist and Internet expert. He says that, at one time, porn and [pirated]{盗版的} materials were commonly shared on these systems.
 - These little areas of the Internet that are not [particular]{特别的} popular are great places for [nefarious]{邪恶的,不法的} [characters]{人物}.
 - Most of that business has [migrated]{迁移} onto the [mainstream]{主流} web, along with all the legal activities, too. SDF is now really just a [hangout]{巢穴、(流氓)住所} for computer [hobbyists]{爱好者}.
 - Back in the '80s, when users still had to use [landline]{固网通信，地上通讯线} telephones to connect ...
 - Today, users from around the globe are on SDF, but they still do [occasionally]{偶尔,间或} meet up in person.
 - I haven't come across anyone in [Concord]{地名:康科德}, New Hampshire. 
 - For now, Pat McNameeking is satisfied just surfing around on SDF. Rob Fleishman told me that this type of computing will never totally [fade away]{逐渐消失}. There will always be users that are willing to trade the [bells and whistles]{花里胡哨,额外的卖点} of a website for the hard [elegance]{典雅} of code, but because SDF requires some serious computer [know-how]{专有知识}, it will likely stay limited to the Internet's basement.
 - For NPR News, I'm Todd Bookman in Concord, New Hampshire.
