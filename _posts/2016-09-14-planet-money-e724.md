- it [slides]{滑行} across the floor, and they have a rug that's a little bit [rumpled]{弄皱} up. 

 - Ripple Rug: 见[图片](http://i1.wp.com/consciouscat.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SafetyFeatures_Diagram-e1457042145439.png?resize=500%2C333) 
- It is basically the size of a [doormat]{门口气垫}.

- they have [wadded]{揉成团} up the carpet

- 39.99 a pop

- Basically, people were [scalping]{倒卖} Ripple Rugs. 

- Buying them on Amazon and selling them on eBay at a [markup]{加成}.
 
- a [wholesale]{批发} price.

- I’ve sent [cease]{终止} and [desist]{停止} orders to every single one of them.

- We've used it before - [arbitrage]{套利者}. 

- [drop shipping]{直接代发货}

- It is easy to [resent]{对…感到愤恨} people who have found a way to make some easy money. 

- And that comes with a whole [boatload]{大量} of fees apparently. 

- a fee for [restocking]{补货}. 

- They don't have [possession]{拥有} of any of those things. 

- They were working for private [contractors]{承包商}

- You know, [groceries]{食品杂货} and household-type stuff and furniture. 

- They start out selling mostly toys and [novelty]{新奇} items. 

- we've got some tools in there that kind of [automate]{使自动化} everything

- But to Fred and Natasha, the cat rug makers, these guys on the internet were just [scalpers]{黄牛}. 

- That [mentality]{心态} creates this opportunity for people.

- We don't want to look around on the internet, so the middlemen are saving us a couple of [keystrokes]{按键}.

- It would [literally]{确确实实地} take 5 seconds.

- it's [simultaneously]{同时地} created all these opportunities for people to jump in and make things even easier but to take a little [slice]{部分} of the profit here and there.

- That's the [essence]{本质} of being a middleman.

- I’m comparing the economic logic of selling [reductions]{折扣} and [transactions]{交易} cost.

- It is [irresistible]{不可抗拒的} and [inevitable]{必然发生的}.

- First thing in the morning, check for [arbitrageurs]{套利者}. 

- It was taking up an [inordinate]{超出合理限度的；过分的} amount of time, and it was super stressful.

- Fred did something [drastic]{极端的}. 

- [Integrity]{正直} is important to us.

- they [converted]{改装} their garage into a little packing facility. 

- They've gotten really good with those [envelopes]{包裹}.

- All of that is true, but there is an emotional [component]{要素} to business. 


KEY POINTS: Amazon, eBay, middleman, drop-shipper, arbitrage.
