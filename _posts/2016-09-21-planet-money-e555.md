- Last [aisle]{走道} at the end of the back of the store.

- The [Omnivore’s]{杂食动物} [Dilemma]{窘境}

- which is not [homogenized]{使均质} but [pasteurized]{对…进行巴氏消毒} and is whole.

- I'm pretty [lactose] {乳糖}[intolerant]{过敏的}, so I don't drink much milk.

- So you're [disqualified]{取消…的资格} from this conversation as being lactose intolerant.

- as an [academic]{学者}

- So you'll see some cool new [cracker]{薄脆饼干}, and you'll buy it. 

- No one has to [lug]{吃力地搬运} the milk through the store to some cooler in the front.

- which is kind of a [radical]{激进的} argument

- at [subliminal]{潜意识的} levels

- To make us [drowsy]{昏昏欲睡的}? 

- Why does the [granola]{格兰诺拉麦片} always seem to be so hard to find? 

- [speculating]{推测} about it

- it's clear we don't have a lot of [empirical]{以经验为依据的} data on 

- that's so [tedious]{单调乏味的}.

- I tried not to [bias]{偏见} them

- I played them [excerpts]{摘录} from each of the interviews so they could react and we could keep score. 
 
 - the wide [array ]{大批} of items 
 
 - It's [folklore]{民俗学}
 
 - [cold chain]{低温运输系统}

 - The idea is that once the milk comes out of a cow, gets [pasteurized]{对…进行巴氏消毒} and put in that gallon [jug]{壶}, you never want to take the milk out of a refrigerated environment. 
 
 - The next answer, though, was not [ambiguous]{有歧义的}. 
 
 - it's a consumer [misconception]{错误观念} 
 
 - it's kind of his [incentive]{刺激} not to suggest that it's some [sinister]{阴险的} policy to get people to buy stuff.

 - I’m [amazed]{使大为惊奇} Michael got two votes already.

 - But Wansink [sided with]{支持} Russ. 

 - there's this big [conspiracy]{阴谋活动} that's going on at the grocery stores. 
 
 - eventually, after the second or third [iteration]{迭代}, it'd be in the back.

 - It's not like there's some [binder]{活页夹} at every supermarket's headquarters titled Optimal Milk Placement Analysis. 
 
 - I will be more [fulsome]{过分恭维的} in my answer and make sure I pay [sufficient]{充足的} attention to the idea of the cold chain.
 
 - And I'm willing to [concede]{退让} that I may sometimes [overestimate]{高估} its power.
