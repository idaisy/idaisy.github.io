*简介在最下方*

- And everybody has to look them up online like OMB and TPP and [repatriation]{调回本国（of money）} and [offshore]{在境外} profits - and the [bragging]{吹嘘} one.

- And the reason I say that is not in a [braggadocios]{自夸，吹牛} way. 

- Sam Sanders, you've been to this man's [rallies]{集会}.

- [deal-making]{交易决策} ability 

- It is a glossary in [alphabetical]{按字母顺序的} order.

- So let's go to No. 2 in the [glossary]{术语表}.

- [carried interest]{附带权益，风险投资基金经理从基金的投资利润中分得的部分}

- Both Trump and Clinton want to get rid of this [loophole]{漏洞}. 

- selling the [merchandise]{商品} 

- And that gives the captain a really good [incentive]{刺激} to get the ship from point A to point B. And it gives him an incentive to sell the [cargo]{货物} at a good price when he gets there.

- They get their [percentage]{利润分成}, their carried interest.

- They're [devaluing]{使...贬值} their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.

- No, it sounds very [bleak]{凄惨的}.

- [Nefarious]{恶毒的}.

- so that it was [artificially]{人工的} low compared to the dollar. 

- [prop up]{支持} the yuan

- That means jobs and [infrastructure]{基础设施} in [advanced manufacturing]{先进制造}.

- making [draperies]{布料} 

- Politics [inherently]{内在地} is [aspirational]{有抱负的}. 

- we're sort of [fixated]{异常迷恋的} on these disappearing parts of American culture.

- [Trojan Horse]{特洛伊木马}

- The [textile]{纺织品} industry took a really big hit, but it was good for consumers. 

- while [significant]{值得关注的}, is still a really small part of the U.S. GDP.

- It's a kind of a [pet peeve]{特别讨厌的东西} of mine, the TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

- a larger [riff]{重复段} 

- And they end up [lumping]{把...归并在一起} TPP together with China.

- done with my [rant]{咆哮}.

- I call it [Trumped-up trickle-down]{川普上经济倒} because that's exactly what it would be.

- Classic [zinger]{有力地驳斥}.

- So we all kind of [groaned]{呻吟} when we were watching it. 

- It's both so [hokey]{矫揉造作的} and yet her sort of [smirk]{得意地笑} as she said it, there was a kind of pride of [authorship]{作者}.

- This was called [trickle-down economics]{涓滴效应}[里根经济学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics) by [critics]{评论家}. 

- And they will hire [landscapers]{庭院设计家} and architects.

- And Hillary Clinton was very, very [vocal]{发声的} about wanting to increase taxes for the wealthy.

- Now this is one of those [perennial]{持久的} debates between [Democrats]{民主党} and [Republicans]{共和党}

- I'm extremely under [leveraged]{杠杆}.

- [encounters]{邂逅} somebody in the [hallway]{走廊} 

- I was on the underleveraged [cleanse diet]{断食减肥法}.

- And so people will [critique]{评论} him and say, well, he [contradicts]{与...相矛盾} himself.

- He relies on [exaggeration]{夸大} and [hyperbole]{夸张} and going there to get the deal that he wants. 

- my ears obviously [perked]{活跃} up at that point.

- Janet Yellen- the chair of the [Federal Reserve]{联邦储备系统}

- try to [sway]{摇摆，支配} the election.

- a political [lens]{镜头}.

- And really [parse]{在句法上分析} the definitions.

- So it's perfectly fine to [stress over]{重视} these words

- When we grow older, I will [reminisce]{缅怀往事}.


## 希拉里VS川普首场电视辩论议题讨论

9个混淆不清的经济概念

1.自我吹嘘。

2.附带权益。私募股权公司的经理利用他人的资金进行投资，在其获取收益的部分提成。这部分收入不计入固定收入税，而是缴纳更低税率的投资税。川普和希拉里都希望去除此漏洞，赋税平等。

3.操纵货币。指控中国让货币贬值，使得中国的商品在美国更有竞争力。然而事实相反，中国在努力提高人民币价值。

4.改变制造业。工厂/公司流出，寻求更低的人力成本，美国国内工作减少。但是，重点在于制造业就业岗位在美国仅占9%，更多的岗位在服务业，政客们在辩论中避而不谈（政治游戏不是那么简单的:-D）

5.NAFTA北美自由贸易协定。川普抨击其为史上最糟糕的协定。NPR嘉宾认为该说法有夸大之嫌。

NAFTA消除了与加拿大和墨西哥之间的保护性关税，降低了双方的商品成本，更利于消费者。墨西哥的低人力成本使其商品更具价格方面竞争优势，最终导致美国国内就业减少。

6.TPP跨太平洋伙伴关系协定。辩论中二位将美国经济衰退归咎于TPP&中国，将TPP与中国混为一谈，但中国并未加入TPP。

7.辩论高潮，希拉里绝妙反击"Trumped-up trickle-down"。川普计划通过税收优惠达到涓滴效应。

8.高度评价自己。TRUMP: I'm extremely underleveraged.

9.川普指控联邦储备系统主席Janet Yellen
