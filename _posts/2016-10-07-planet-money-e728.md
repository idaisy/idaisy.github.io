## Wells Fargo造假丑闻

美国第三大银行Wells Fargo陷入丑闻被指造假，在客户或许并不知情的情况下开设了超过200万个账户，涉及活期储蓄账户、信用卡、贷款。

Wells Fargo应对该丑闻的措施是开除了超5000个基层员工。

美国消费者金融保护局（CFPB）向其开出了该机构史上最大的一笔罚单1.85亿美元。

Wells Fargo的CEO-John Stumpf的座右铭"eight is great"

过高的销售指标压力成为员工们造假的一大原因，员工每天需要拨打上百个电话。

前职员Ashley的小故事，旧金山克罗克分行被抢，嫌犯被抓，在银行大厅满是警察吵闹混乱的情况下，其主管依旧要求她不停的打销售电话。

管理层对底下员工的不道德甚至违法行为睁一只眼闭一只眼。
