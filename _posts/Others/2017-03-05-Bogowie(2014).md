**在波兰，心脏是一种"神圣遗物"，心脏移植术属于"伦理模糊范畴"。Religa想在国内开心脏移植术的先河困难重重。**

Cutting a beating heart out of... A body. A human being.It's ethically vague.

I know that, in our country, the heart is a relic. But we both know it's a muscle.

We could give life to many people. Or false hope.

**组建诊所过程中，资金和人员的空缺。**

**手术遭受媒体的质疑**

Will Dr. Religa solve the problem? And more importantly, should he try again?

**手术失败后来自官方波兹南卫生部的谴责**

"Religa, you're not God. "
"Quit killing people, ambition has eaten your conscience. " - by: Poznan Health Dept. 

**Professor Jan.Moll（波兰开展心脏移植手术的先驱）在弥留之际对Religa的开导**

what's the biggest problem?

Qualifying patients for surgery?  - No.

Cyclosporine dosage?    - No.

The time span?    - Those are not real problems.

The mother's eyes after a failed attempt to save her child?

It's about humility. Failure and success can be equally hard for a doctor. One needs a large dose of humility.

**The first transplant, Zabrze. October 1985**
Time of death : 8:02 pm, 6th day after the transplant.

**The second transplant, Zabrze, November 1985**
30 days after the surgery, the second heart recipient died.

**The 3rd transplant, April 1986.**
Time of death: 5:50 pm. Direct cause: asystole. The transplanted heart infarcted, probably right before the transplant.

**The fourth transplant, Zabrze, May 1986**
The patient of the 4th transplant lived 7 years with the new heart

Until today more than 1000 heart transplanters have been performed in Zabrze.

Prof. Religa died on March 8th 2009

**Religa多次手术尝试，每次遇到手术失败，即使不是自己的过错，依旧会喝的烂醉如泥。失败的自责，各方的谴责质疑，都成为了执刀时的阻碍。直至Religa从Moll教授的开导中醒悟，向已故病人Ewka的母亲道歉，得到了她母亲的谅解"It was Gods plan." 最终，第四次心脏移植术获得了巨大突破，成功地为病人延续了7年生命。**

Joke "The guy is heartless."

The fourth transplant, Zabrze, May 1986

D: How are you feeling, director?

P: I'm worried about one thing. 

D: What is it?

P: That I'll be heartless again.  

D: Just for 15 minutes. 

P: I hope nothing stupid comes to my mind at that time.

D: You'll tell us tomorrow.

**吐槽：背景音乐无限单曲循环，hhh...**
