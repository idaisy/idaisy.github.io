- [Kansas]{美国堪萨斯州} City, Mo. In [Wichita]{威奇托}. [McPherson, Kan. And Omaha]{地名}.

- a hundred [barrels]{桶} of [crude oil]{原油}.

- We had to find a [refinery]{精炼厂} willing to take our oil.

- What are you going to do, take 100 barrels of oil and [stack]{在...上堆放} them in the office?

- It has shaped our [civilization]{文明}, and it's an [intimate]{亲密的} part of our lives. 

- it has also [exacted]{索取} an [enormous]{庞大的} price. 

- The whole industry is sort of [veiled]{掩饰} in mystery. 

- [refine]{提炼} oil and ship it through a [pipeline]{管道} to its final customer.

- Your [gas tank]{油箱}.

- [Saudi Arabia]{沙特阿拉伯}
 
- we have an appointment with a [preacher]{传道者} in Kansas.

- Also, he's a [pastor]{牧师}, so we figured we could trust him. 

- a cow [pasture]{牧场} 

- [haul]{拖} our oil 

- I think I was picturing some [barren]{贫瘠的} [wasteland]{荒地} with oil [derricks]{井架} as far as the eye could see. 

- the [oil wells]{油井} 

- [vast]{巨大的} fields 

- [precisely]{精确地} straight.

- And we [veer]{转向} off into this [prairie]{大草原} grass through this [herd]{兽群} of black cows, and we find Jason.

- He's standing next to his red [pickup]{轻型货车}, and next to him is this [rusty]{生锈的} machine plunging a metal [rod]{杆} into the mud.

- Like a [teeter-totter]{跷跷板}

- He was a [roustabout]{油井杂工}, which is basically, like, a [handyman]{杂务工}.

- And on Sundays, he [preaches]{宣讲} the [gospel]{福音}.

- I'm not your [cookie-cutter]{千篇一律的} mold for a preacher. 

- I stepped over beside the [rig]{设备} and grabbed a chain and hooked the chain up. 

- And there is a [stump]{残肢} where his middle finger used to be. 

- It taps into this vast [reserve]{储备} of oil that is deep under the ground underneath Oklahoma and Kansas. 

- In its day, this well might have been a [gusher]{自喷井}. 

- the bottom of the [milkshake]{奶昔}?

- tiny [faucet]{水龙头} 

- black [cylinder]{圆柱体} 

- It's [spiked]{用尖物刺伤}. It's [plunged]{突然跌落}. And a lot of that has been because of [fracking]{水力压裂法}, which has flooded the market with American oil. 

- So you're just on that [rollercoaster]{过山车}. 

- Let's [negotiate]{商定} the price for our 100 barrels of oil.

- We're in bed [reception]{接待}. 

- the most expensive [column]{列}.

- It's in a [dip]{微降}. 

- Jason is [beaming]{笑容满面} now. 

- But he says he will [budge]{让步} a little.

- It was really fun, but there were many, many months of work and [toil]{辛劳} and phone calls that went into this. 

- If you could sign this just as a [receipt]{收据} that I handed you that money.

- I'm kind of [parched]{使...极干燥} here.
